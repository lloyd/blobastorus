* use browserid instead of twitter auth
* https is currently required for every transaction.  That sucks, but if we wanted to only use it for moving secrets to the client
  then we would need to solve the following two problems:
  + secure the set api with some kind of signature nonce or challenge/response
  + move secrets from https://blobastor.us to http://blobastor.us on the client
  Both of these challenges are kinda interesting, but not really needed for a first cut.
